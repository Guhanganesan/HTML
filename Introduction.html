 HTML is a type of markup language. 
 It encapsulates, or “marks up” data within HTML tags, 
 which define the data and describe its purpose on the webpage. 
 The web browser then reads the HTML,which tells it things like which parts are headings, 
 which parts are paragraphs, which parts are links, etc.

 <p>
 The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a standard for describing the structure and presentation of information via the Internet.

 HTML. First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. 
 HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. 
 Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks
